# Idol Story: Tomoya Mashiro (1)

> **Season:** Spring
> **Location:** Dance Studio

**Tomoya:** "Come now, everyone! Take a look and laugh!"

"I am a clown who seeks to spread laughter through silly antics!"

"Feel free to spit and throw rocks at me to cast away your daily sorrows! ♪"

(Ugh... That came out differently than I'd expected.)

(What am I doing wrong? I can't get into my role!)

(They told me that it would be a bit more challenging this time, but I should've learned some techniques from last year...)

(I stumble the moment I step out of my comfort zone. What am I supposed to do? I wish I was better at applying my skills into new roles—)

Eek!

Ah, you scared me! D-Do you need something, Producer? Man, with all that clapping out of nowhere, I thought you were a ghost!

You sure have a quiet presence... Oh, hold on. Is my time in the dance studio up?

So you're here to tell me to leave?

I'm sorry! I was actually practicing with everyone else in Ra\*bits, but Hajime and Mitsuru had to do work of their own. That's why I'm here alone.

There was some time left in the booking, so I thought I might as well do some rehearsal by myself!

I couldn't practice my part for Ra*bits since I wanted the others to keep pace.

Shit, I was so caught up in rehearsing that I lost track of time! I'll pack up and leave right away—

Woah?!

Ahaha. Guess I tripped...♪

You were laughing just now huh, Producer? Oh no, I'm not saying that was rude.

That laugh! That's the exact reaction I wanted out of my audience! Um, could you tell me what was so funny about what I just did?

Oh, I'm being too pushy? Sorry, I was in a rush...

You see, I'm starting to get some real acting jobs. The role I got cast for this time is a bit challenging...

*Sigh,* this all started because I've been in the Drama Club for quite a while. During one of the performances I was in, someone took notice and scouted me.

That gave me an opportunity to be in movies and theatricals, though they were all supporting roles.

It's quite rare for someone to act well despite looking like a child nowadays.

I've been taking advantage of this feature of mine here and there.

When people think of child actors, they think of me, Tomoya Mashiro! ...That's the kind of reputation I have at this point, more or less.

But I'm already a second year! I'm not sure how to feel about being considered a "child actor"...

Well, I'm happy to get the roles either way. I do love acting, after all.

Plus, Ra*bits is struggling a bit right now with how we have to do solo gigs on the side to get by.

It's the same for Nii-chan, who's already gone off to college. Each of us has to improve our own skills to gain individual popularity.

By doing so, we can draw attention to the unit.

That's why I want to make a name for myself as an actor.

However, I want to be noticed as an idol and for Ra\*bits.

Our agency, Rhythm Link, is well-known and has a long history. It's pretty hard to stand out.

These guys tend to prioritize seniority over merit, so the people who've been here for a long time take all the high-profile jobs.

We rarely get any worthwhile opportunities.

Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm not criticizing the agency.

That's one reason why we chose to be in Rhythm Link. Their status and long history can be beneficial to us!

Anyways... Umm, what was I talking about again? I always lose myself when I get too excited.

Where was I? Well, I was given the chance to perform with a fairly renowned theater company.

I was cast as a little clown or, to be more precise, a mischievous fairy.

Yep, it's similar to Puck from *A Midsummer Night's Dream.* I play a trickster who skips across the stage and causes trouble.

The role reminded me of two guys I look up to, so I was really motivated!

Yet I wasn't able to pull it off... Back at my school's Drama Club, I only played as princes and princesses. I'd over-exaggerate my parts no matter what I do.

I don't have to ask anyone to tell nobody's going to find my performance entertaining as is.

I was too stiff, let alone playful. So the feeling of a mischievous fairy didn't come across at all.

Huh? I should mimic Ra*bits' behavior instead?

Sure, I guess we get treated like fairies sometimes.

But our behavior typically resembles what good kids do. My role requires pulling pranks and having a sharp tongue, so I don't think that fits...

If I emphasize Ra*bits too much, I would tarnish our pure and innocent image.

Maybe people will grow tired of us if we just stick to being good kids.

However, that's only the brand we made for Ra\*bits.

I want to keep that image. I know I'm trying to eat my cake and have it too...

But a true actor—a true idol—makes the impossible possible and turns dreams into reality. That is who I, Tomoya Mashiro, aspire to be.
